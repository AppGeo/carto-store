# carto-store

A prototype of dynamically styling and setting sql for Carto using Carto v4.
The idea is to also include legends, infowindows, and hover cards.
Saving changes would be versioned via a version in the url that becomes the public API, e.g. somedomain.com/api/v1/project/layername/versionnumber/layerdata
